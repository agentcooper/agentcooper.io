It is December 2023, I am working on my [compiler](https://github.com/agentcooper/eye), getting back into running, reading fantastic book [*The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thousand_Autumns_of_Jacob_de_Zoet), and trying to meet up with all my local friends before the end of the year.

I write [monthly lookbacks](http://agentcooper.io) on this website.

This page is inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com).
