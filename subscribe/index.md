Updates are available through an [RSS feed](/rss.xml).

RSS is an open protocol that allows you to follow many different websites through an app called an RSS reader. For Apple devices, I can recommend [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) and [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com). If you want to use a web app, [Feedly](https://feedly.com) seems alright.
