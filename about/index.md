Iâ€™m a software engineer living in Amsterdam. Currently, I work at Apple and I've worked at Uber before that.

If you are passing by Amsterdam, feel free to drop a message. We can grab a coffee and chat about computers, programming languages, biology, movies, expat life, Russia, video games, startups, running, or something else.
