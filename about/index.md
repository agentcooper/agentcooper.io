I am now enjoying a sabbatical. Before that, I worked at Apple and Uber on developer tools.

If you are in Amsterdam, feel free to say hello. We can grab a coffee and chat about computers, compilers, programming languages, biology, movies, playing guitar, expat life, Russia, video games, startups, running, or something else.
