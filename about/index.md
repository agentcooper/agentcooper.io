Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Artem and I'm a software engineer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

I am now finishing my sabbatical and will be open for work in compilers and programming languages. Before that, I worked at Apple and Uber on developer tools. I enjoy working on [personal open-source projects](https://github.com/agentcooper).

If you are in Amsterdam, feel free to say hello. We can grab a coffee and chat about computers, compilers, programming languages, small web, biology, movies, playing guitar, expat life, Russia, Japan, video games, startups, running, or something else.

I'm not on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, but you can see my profile on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/evilagentcooper/) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4207679-artem-tyurin).
