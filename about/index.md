I am now enjoying a sabbatical. Before that, I worked at Apple and Uber on developer tools.

If you are in Amsterdam, feel free to say hello. We can grab a coffee and chat about computers, compilers, programming languages, biology, movies, playing guitar, expat life, Russia, video games, startups, running, or something else.

I'm not on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, but you can see my profile on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/evilagentcooper/) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4207679-artem-tyurin).
