The daylight time is getting shorter, and so is this lookback.

A few friends are back in the city after their long trips, so I spent most of the month catching up with everyone.

I've attended my first proper Thanksgiving dinner, where I randomly met another person who works for Apple in the Netherlands.

To further fuel my interest in biology, I've signed up for the [Biohack Academy 2022](https://waag.org/en/event/biohack-academy-2022) that starts in February. It is a 10-week program with lectures and, most exciting, lab experiments.

I am also continuing with the MIT course.

I've read a book of essays and blog posts of [Anton Nossik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Nossik), and it brought back memories of working at LiveJournal where I met Anton a few times. His unexpected death was a deep shock to me. His writing and way of thought had a big influence on me at the time.

After returning from Moscow, I've [watched](https://letterboxd.com/evilagentcooper/films/diary/for/2021/11/) Soviet and Russian movies. A few I can recommend are: [I Am Twenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Twenty) (1965), [The Cranes Are Flying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cranes_Are_Flying) (1957), and [Silent Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Souls) (2010).

I've also had an opportunity to watch a very [recent documentary about the Moscow subway](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/eb9b9991-16b9-43a8-8def-7231a4dba9b4/where-are-we-headed) that was featured on IDFA. Heartwarming and sad at the same time, like many things about modern Russia.

The need to create a wishlist for a Secret Santa event triggered my OCD, and I spent a few hours adding the "owned" tag and many others to [the book list on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4207679-artem?shelf=owned).

I thought of picking a new sport activity after completing a marathon, but most indoor options like weight lifting, rock climbing, or squash are still limited due to the recent lockdown. So I think I'll start running again as it is a suitable opportunity to drag myself outside to catch a bit of daylight.
